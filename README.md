# offertmotor-upgrades

This is for the OffertMotor upgrades

Upgrades include:
* Administration (ie. all inputs need to be in DB and a UI - simple to handle it)
* Offers from different companies - they need to be specified with logos in and other information in Administrator
* Several products and product images - also handled in administration
* Regional partitioning of companies - i.e. If Company ONE works in Stockholm, Sweden they should only reply to an ”offer request” from Stockholm, Sweden but there can be multiple companies in one region (if multiple companies work in the same area it will be random who’s offer will go out)
